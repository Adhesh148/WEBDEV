		<h2>About the Project</h2>
		<p><b>Live Time Table</b> allows students to view their everyday schedule including:
			<ol>
				<li>Regular Classes (excluding cancelled ones)</li>
				<li>Extra Classes planned for the week</li>
				<li>Scheduled Events such as:
					<ol>
					<li>Talks</li>
					<li>Workshops</li>
					<li>Cultural or Technical Fests</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
			A Live Time Table would help the student better plan his <b>time</b> and also keep track of events ocurring in the college.
		</p>

	<h2>Use Case</h2>
	Consider the situation that a professor for the COE/CED-18 decides to cancel the 9:00 A.M class on a particular day. This creates a free slot at 9:00 AM. Considering the traditional timetable system no other professor would know of the free slot unless informed by the CR. The traditional system demands the need for human-human communication which could be unreliable at certain times.
	Our system eliminates the need for human-human communication. An update/deletion on the time time table would be immediately reflected online. This enables the professors and students to plain their day accordingly. For instace, the professor taking the 8:00 A.M. class could shift his class to this interval without the need for any intimidation by the CR. It also saves on sending hundreds of mails by allowing students to view the updated time table live.
